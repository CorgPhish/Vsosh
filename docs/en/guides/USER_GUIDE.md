Click the icon to open the extension popup for more details and options.

## Understanding the Interface

The CorgPhish interface consists of several components:

### Main Popup

When you click the CorgPhish icon, you'll see:
- **Status indicator**: Shows if the current site is safe, suspicious, or dangerous
- **Site details**: Information about the current website
- **Threat details**: If threats are detected, details will be displayed here
- **Quick actions**: Buttons to whitelist the site, report a false positive, or open settings

### Settings Page

Access the settings page by clicking the gear icon in the popup. Here you can:
- Enable/disable protection features
- Customize alert behavior

## Security Features

### Real-time Protection

CorgPhish continuously monitors your browsing activity to detect phishing attempts:

- **URL Analysis**: Checks for suspicious URL patterns and known phishing domains
- **Content Analysis**: Examines page content for phishing indicators
- **Form Detection**: Identifies suspicious forms that might steal your credentials
- **Link Analysis**: Analyzes links on the page for potential deception

This protection runs automatically in the background with minimal performance impact.

### Deep Scanning

For enhanced security, enable Deep Scanning in the settings. This feature:

- Performs a more thorough analysis of web pages
- Detects hidden elements that might be used for phishing
- Identifies obfuscated code that could be malicious
- Monitors redirect chains that might lead to phishing sites
- Analyzes iframes and embedded content

Note: Deep Scanning may slightly increase resource usage.

### Google Safe Browsing Integration

CorgPhish can integrate with Google Safe Browsing API for additional protection:

1. In the Settings page, navigate to the "Google Safe Browsing" section
2. Enter your API key (obtain one from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/))
3. Click "Verify & Save" to enable the integration

This provides an additional layer of protection using Google's extensive database of unsafe websites.

## Customizing Settings
